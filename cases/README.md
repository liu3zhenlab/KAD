### Case study to illustrate KAD analysis

**Case 1**  
*- Evaluation of *E. coli* genomes with KAD analysis*  

In this case, two versions of *E. coli* genome aseemblies and Illumina read data were downloaded. Analyses for KAD profiling, KAD distribution, and KAD comparison were performed. Partial results were deposited here as well.
