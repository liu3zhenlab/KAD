### Activation of Regeneration Candidate Genes

#### Background
In 2019, Dr. Hairong Wei helped selected some regeneration candidate genes based on network analyses. Also, RNA-Seq from the callus experiments (type II vs. I and fast vs. slow) were used as the reference. In total, 31 genes were selected. Among these 30 genes, 9 genes were selected for the validation using various strategies.

#### New strategy for validation
Yiping Qi shared a gene expression activation system with CRISPR/dCas9. We would like to try the system to validate all 30 genes and other genes that can be possibly added.

Briefly, guide RNAs are designed for genes to be validated on their promoter regions. These guide RNAs are pooled to make CRISPR constructs, which are transferred to the embryotic callus tissue. A marker gene GFP is included in each construct. The contruct pool should cover all genes with guide RNAs designed. The callus cells with an effective activation are anticipated to grow faster and better than other callus cells. We, therefore, are able to observe fluroscent sectors that can be dissected for further culture and analysis.

In the current design, we added the genes that are up-regulated in both type II and fast-growth calli as compared to their respective controls. In total 15 genes were identified and three of them are in the 2019 candidate list. Therefore, 12 new genes are added. In total, 43 genes are in the updated regeneration candidate gene list.
